# Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales data spanning 2014 to 2017. The aim is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights by examining the impact of discounts, identifying trends over time, and uncovering the top-performing products, customers, regions, and segments. The results are intended to guide decision-making around pricing strategies, marketing prioritization, inventory management, and resource allocation.

### Objectives

- The analysis addresses the following key questions:

- What is the impact of discounts on sales and profit?

- What are the total sales and profit trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)?

- Which product categories and sub-categories generate the most revenue and profit?

- Which product categories or sub-categories should be prioritized for marketing and inventory restocking?

- Who are the top customers based on total sales and profit contribution?

- Which regions or cities have the highest and lowest sales performance?

- Which customer segments are the most profitable?

- Which products are the best-sellers and worst-sellers?

- Which products have the highest return in terms of profit margin?

### Data Transformation

- Loaded raw transactions and calculated before-/after-discount metrics per unit and in total.

- Derived additional fields: profit margins, actual revenue after discounts, and aggregated sums.

- Cleaned and standardized date fields, extracted year and month for trend analysis.

## Analysis & Outcomes

Below are the key findings corresponding to each objective:

>> #### Impact of Discounts on Sales and Profit

- Overall revenue increased from ~$11.48 M before discounts to ~$11.49 M after discounts.

- Profit rose from ~$280.4 K to ~$286.4 K following discount application, indicating that strategic discounts drove incremental volume and profit.

>>> ### Sales and Profit Trends Over Time

- Yearly revenue grew steadily: 2014 ($2.47 M) → 2015 ($2.38 M) → 2016 ($3.05 M) → 2017 ($3.58 M).

- Profit followed a similar upward trajectory.

- Seasonal peaks observed in Q4 each year, with December being the highest revenue month.

>>> ### Top Product Categories & Sub-Categories

- Categories by Revenue: Technology ($4.08 M), Furniture ($3.86 M), Office Supplies ($3.55 M).

- Top Sub-Categories: Chairs ($1.66 M), Phones ($1.63 M), Tables (~$1.14 M).

>>> ### Prioritization for Marketing & Inventory

- Focus on Technology and Furniture categories, especially Chairs and Phones sub-categories.

- Monitor underperforming sub-categories like Tables due to negative profitability.

>>> ### Top Customers

- Highest sales volumes: Sean Miller ($146.7 K), Adrian Barton ($143.9 K), Tamara Chand (~$92.6 K).

- Profitability varies; some high-volume customers generated negative returns, suggesting review of discount terms.

>>> ### Regional Performance

- Top Regions by Sales: West ($3.60 M), East ($3.38 M); Bottom: South (~$2.04 M).

- West and East also lead in profit contribution.

>>> ### Customer Segments

- Most Profitable Segment: Consumer (~$5.82 M sales, ~$134.1 K profit).

- Corporate and Home Office segments follow.

>>> ### Best-Sellers & Worst-Sellers

- Top Units Sold: Product TEC-AC-10003832 (75 units), OFF-PA-10001970 (70 units).

- Lowest Units Sold: Several products with only 1 unit sold; evaluate for potential phase-out.

>>> ### Highest Profit Margin Products

- Products with profit margins above 20% are prime candidates for upselling and premium positioning.

# Conclusions & Recommendations

- Discount Strategy Validation: Discounts can increase both revenue and profit when applied judiciously.

- Growth Opportunities: Expand inventory and marketing spend in high-performing categories (Technology, Furniture) and sub-categories (Chairs, Phones).

- Customer Management: Reassess terms for high-volume customers with low or negative profits.

- Geographic Focus: Allocate resources to Western and Eastern regions, where returns are strongest.

- Segment Tactics: Tailor promotions to the Consumer segment for maximum ROI.

- Product Portfolio Optimization: Phase out persistently low-selling, low-margin products.
